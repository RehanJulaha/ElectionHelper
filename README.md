# Election Process Assistant

[![CI](https://github.com/RehanJulaha/ElectionHelper/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/RehanJulaha/ElectionHelper/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![CodeQL](https://github.com/RehanJulaha/ElectionHelper/actions/workflows/codeql.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/RehanJulaha/ElectionHelper/actions/workflows/codeql.yml)

An **educational** single-page app for **India’s Lok Sabha (general election)** process: a step-by-step timeline, **role-based** copy (voter, candidate, observer), a searchable **glossary**, and links to **official Election Commission of India** sources. Content is informational only—users should always verify details with the ECI and their state CEO.

---

## Features

| Area | What you get |
|------|----------------|
| **Timeline** | Ordered phases with keyboard navigation, phase detail, and expandable “Official sources”. |
| **Roles** | Switch perspective to see voter-, candidate-, or observer-oriented summaries where copy differs. |
| **Glossary** | Filterable terms (e.g. NOTA, EPIC, RO, MCC) with English and Hindi strings via **Transloco**. |
| **Resilience** | Election pack JSON is **Zod-validated**, fetched with **retries**, and **cached in `localStorage`** for repeat visits and flaky networks. |
| **Theming** | Light/dark CSS variables loaded from `src/assets/themes/theme.json`. |
| **i18n** | **English** (`en`) and **Hindi** (`hi`); all user-facing strings go through **@ngneat/transloco**. |

---

## Tech stack

- **Angular 19** — standalone components, lazy routes, **zoneless** change detection (`provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection`), **signals** for state.
- **TypeScript 5.7** (strict), **RxJS 7**, **Zod** for runtime validation of bundled JSON packs.
- **Firebase** — Hosting (SPA rewrites + security headers), Firestore rules, optional Functions; see `firebase.json`.
- **Testing** — **Vitest** (domain logic under `src/lib/`), **Karma + Jasmine** (Angular units), **Playwright** + **axe-core** (e2e & accessibility smoke).
- **CI** — GitHub Actions (`lint`, Vitest + coverage, Karma headless, Playwright, path guardrails, CodeQL).

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22** (matches CI; LTS-aligned versions usually work—use 22 for parity with GitHub Actions).
- **npm** 10+ (ships with Node 22).

Optional for deploys and rules tests:

- **Firebase CLI** (`npm i -g firebase-tools` or use `npx firebase`).
- **Chrome** (or Chromium) locally for `npm test` / `npm run test:ci` headless runs.

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RehanJulaha/ElectionHelper.git
cd ElectionHelper
npm ci
npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:4200/** — the dev server uses Angular’s default port unless you override it.

**Production build** (output used by Firebase Hosting):

```bash
npm run build
# Static files: dist/epa/browser
```

---

## NPM scripts

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Dev server (`ng serve`). |
| `npm run build` | Production build → `dist/epa/browser`. |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint (`ng lint`). |
| `npm test` | Karma + Jasmine, headless Chrome. |
| `npm run test:vitest` | Vitest (watch in TTY). |
| `npm run test:ci` | Vitest with coverage, then Karma headless (local CI parity). |
| `npm run test:vitest:rules` | Firestore rules unit tests (Vitest). |
| `npm run test:firestore-rules` | Same tests inside the **Firestore emulator** (`demo-epa` project alias). |
| `npm run e2e:install` | Install Playwright Chromium browser. |
| `npm run e2e` | Playwright suite (includes axe checks on key pages). |

---

## Testing & coverage

- **`src/lib/**`** — validated election helpers; covered by **Vitest** (`tests/unit/…`, `vitest.config.ts` thresholds).
- **`src/app/**`** — components and services; covered by **Karma** when you run `npm test` / `npm run test:ci`.
- **E2E** — `e2e/` Playwright specs; run `npm run e2e:install` once per machine.

Firestore rules specs are **skipped** in plain Vitest unless you use the emulator wrapper script above.

---

## Deploy (Firebase Hosting)

1. Configure your Firebase project in **`.firebaserc`** (`default` project id).
2. Build the SPA: `npm run build`.
3. Deploy hosting (and other targets if you use them): `npx firebase deploy --only hosting` (or full `firebase deploy`).

For GCP project setup, budgets, and boundaries, see **`docs/GCP_PROVISIONING.md`**, **`docs/GCP_BUDGETS.md`**, and **`docs/GCP_FIRESTORE_BOUNDARIES.md`**.

## Security & configuration

- **Do not commit secrets.** Use environment variables or your cloud secret manager; see **`.env.example`** for non-sensitive placeholders only.
- Hosting applies **CSP**, **nosniff**, **Referrer-Policy**, and **Permissions-Policy** (see `firebase.json`).
- Details: **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**.

## Accessibility

Keyboard-first timeline (arrow keys, Home/End), landmarks, skip link, translated error states, and automated **axe** checks in Playwright. See **`docs/A11Y_CHECKLIST.md`** for manual verification.

## Repository layout (high level)

```
src/
  app/           # Routes, shell, timeline & glossary features, services
  assets/        # i18n, themes, static election pack JSON
  lib/election/  # Zod schema, parsing, ordering, glossary helpers (Vitest)
tests/           # Vitest + Firestore rules tests
e2e/             # Playwright specs
functions/       # Firebase Cloud Functions (optional)
```

---

## Continuous integration

Workflows under **`.github/workflows/`**:

- **`ci.yml`** — lint, Vitest + coverage artifact, Karma, Playwright, and a guard that rejects accidental commits of local IDE tooling paths (see the `forbidden-paths` job).
- **`codeql.yml`** — CodeQL for JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **`dependabot.yml`** — Dependency update automation.
